# SNKRS-Monitor
This SNKRS monitor allows you to detect new additions &amp; stock changes and automatically post them to Discord through a bot.


## Instructions
To run this bot you'll need to firstly make sure NodeJS is installed on your system. Then you shall open & run `SneakerMonitor/extras/install.bat` then from here edit the `SneakerMonitor/app.js` file. Add in your bot's token, the GuildID and ChannelID. Once all of these steps are complete and your bot is in your Discord server, ensure you have a channel named the same as your default channel, followed by **-inactive**, for example I have my main channel being **SNKRS** and my second channel being **SNKRS-inactive**. This way your bot can post shoes that are on Nike's backend only, either being Out of Stock or currently unavailable for purchase
